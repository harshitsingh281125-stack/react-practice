# 📝 Todo List App

**Goal:**  
Build a fully functional Todo List to practice **state management, event handling, conditional rendering, and localStorage persistence** — one of the most common React machine coding questions.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- React Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`
- Controlled inputs
- Array manipulation (add, delete, toggle)
- Conditional rendering
- Data persistence using `localStorage`
- Component composition (optional)

---

## ✅ Requirements
1. **Add Todo:** User can type text and add a new todo.  
2. **Display Todos:** Show all todos in a list with each having:  
   - A checkbox to mark as completed  
   - A delete button  
3. **Filter Todos:** Add buttons to filter by:
   - **All**
   - **Active**
   - **Completed**  
4. **Persist Todos:** Save todos in `localStorage` so they remain after reload.  
5. **Show Count:** Display number of remaining active todos.  
6. (Optional) Add an “Enter” key handler to add todos quickly.

## 💡 Bonus Features
- “Clear Completed” button

- Add timestamps for when a todo was created

- Add animations with `framer-motion`
