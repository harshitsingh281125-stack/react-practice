# 🧾 Signup Form

**Goal:**  
Build a simple **signup form** to practice controlled inputs, form validation, and conditional rendering in React.

This is one of the most frequently asked machine coding problems — it tests your understanding of **state management**, **validation**, and **form UX**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Controlled components using `useState`
- Real-time form validation
- Conditional rendering for error messages
- Handling form submission
- Reusable input component design (optional)
- Basic styling and UX feedback

---

## ✅ Requirements

1. **Form Fields:**
   - Full Name  
   - Email  
   - Password  
   - Confirm Password  

2. **Validations:**
   - All fields are required  
   - Email must be valid (e.g., `example@domain.com`)  
   - Password must be at least 6 characters  
   - Confirm Password must match Password  

3. **On Successful Submission:**
   - Show a success message or summary of user input  
   - Clear the form (optional)

4. **On Validation Error:**
   - Show inline error messages under each field

---

## 💡 Bonus Ideas
- Add a **“Show Password”** toggle  
- Add real-time validation feedback as the user types  
- Disable submit button until the form is valid
