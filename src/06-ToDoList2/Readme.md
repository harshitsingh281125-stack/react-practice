✅ Requirements

Add todo: input + add button (Enter should also add).

List todos: each item shows text, checkbox (complete toggle), and delete button.

Filters: buttons for All, Active, Completed — switch view accordingly.

Persistence: save todos in localStorage so they survive page reloads.

Count: display number of active (incomplete) todos.

Edge cases: handle empty input, duplicate text gracefully (your choice).

💡 Nice-to-have (Bonus)

Edit todo inline (double-click or an Edit button).

“Clear completed” button.

“Toggle all” checkbox to mark all complete/incomplete.

Undo delete (temporary snackbar with “Undo”).

Debounce input or useMemo the filtered list for very large datasets.

Simple animations on add/remove (CSS or framer-motion).

Accessibility: keyboard navigation, aria-* attributes.
